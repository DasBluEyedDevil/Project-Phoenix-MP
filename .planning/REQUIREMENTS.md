# Requirements: Project Phoenix MP

**Defined:** 2026-02-13
**Core Value:** Users can connect to their Vitruvian trainer and execute workouts reliably on both platforms.

## v0.4.5 Requirements

Requirements for milestone v0.4.5 — Premium Features Phase 1.

### Data Foundation (Spec 00 Phase A)

- [ ] **DATA-01**: App stores per-rep metrics (position, velocity, load curves) in RepMetric table
- [ ] **DATA-02**: User subscription tier (FREE/PHOENIX/ELITE) is stored and queryable
- [ ] **DATA-03**: FeatureGate utility provides tier-based feature access checks
- [ ] **DATA-04**: Database migration v13 creates RepMetric table with sync fields
- [ ] **DATA-05**: iOS DriverFactory is synced with schema version 13

### LED Biofeedback (Spec 02)

- [ ] **LED-01**: Machine LED color changes based on velocity zone during workout
- [ ] **LED-02**: LED transitions are throttled to max 2Hz with hysteresis to prevent flicker
- [ ] **LED-03**: TUT/TUT Beast modes show tempo guide feedback (green = correct tempo)
- [ ] **LED-04**: Echo mode shows load matching feedback (green = target matched)
- [ ] **LED-05**: PR achievement triggers celebration flash sequence
- [ ] **LED-06**: User can enable/disable LED biofeedback in settings (Phoenix+ tier)
- [ ] **LED-07**: LED biofeedback respects rest periods (blue during rest)

### Rep Quality Scoring (Spec 02)

- [ ] **QUAL-01**: Each rep receives a quality score (0-100) based on 4 components
- [ ] **QUAL-02**: ROM consistency contributes up to 30 points (deviation from set average)
- [ ] **QUAL-03**: Velocity consistency contributes up to 25 points (deviation from set average)
- [ ] **QUAL-04**: Eccentric control contributes up to 25 points (ecc:conc time ratio)
- [ ] **QUAL-05**: Movement smoothness contributes up to 20 points (jerk/variance metric)
- [ ] **QUAL-06**: Per-rep quality indicator shows on HUD during workout
- [ ] **QUAL-07**: Set summary displays average, best, and worst rep quality
- [ ] **QUAL-08**: Quality trend (improving/stable/declining) is tracked per set
- [ ] **QUAL-09**: Form Master badges are awarded for quality achievements (Phoenix+ tier)

### Smart Suggestions (Spec 03.2)

- [ ] **SUGG-01**: App tracks weekly volume per muscle group (sets, reps, kg)
- [ ] **SUGG-02**: Push:Pull:Legs balance analysis detects training imbalances
- [ ] **SUGG-03**: Exercise variety prompts notify when an exercise is neglected (>14 days)
- [ ] **SUGG-04**: Plateau detection identifies stalled exercises with breakthrough suggestions
- [ ] **SUGG-05**: Time-of-day analysis identifies optimal training windows (Elite tier)
- [ ] **SUGG-06**: Smart suggestions are gated to Elite tier

### Premium Gating

- [ ] **GATE-01**: LED biofeedback is gated to Phoenix tier and above
- [ ] **GATE-02**: Rep quality features are gated to Phoenix tier and above
- [ ] **GATE-03**: Smart suggestions are gated to Elite tier
- [ ] **GATE-04**: Data capture happens for all users (gating is at UI/feature level only)

## Future Requirements (v0.5.0+)

### Biomechanics (Spec 01)

- **BIO-01**: VBT engine computes mean concentric velocity per rep
- **BIO-02**: Real-time velocity HUD shows speed zones
- **BIO-03**: Force curve visualization in set summary
- **BIO-04**: Asymmetry analysis compares cable A vs cable B

### Auto-Regulation (Spec 03.3-4)

- **AUTO-01**: Warmup velocity establishes exercise baseline
- **AUTO-02**: Readiness score adjusts suggested weights
- **AUTO-03**: In-set fatigue detection alerts when to stop

### Platform Features (Spec 04)

- **PLAT-01**: Strength assessment onboarding wizard
- **PLAT-02**: Exercise auto-detection from rep patterns

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Portal sync with RepMetric data | No backend until Spec 05 complete |
| Subscription billing (RevenueCat) | Blocked on auth migration |
| Advanced recovery heatmap | Spec 03.5 future scope |
| ML-based predictions | No ML infrastructure; all intelligence is statistical |

## Traceability
