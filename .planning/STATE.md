**Core value:** Users can connect to their Vitruvian trainer and execute workouts reliably on both platforms.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - LED Biofeedback

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (LED Biofeedback)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Plan 02-01 complete, ready for 02-02
Last activity: 2026-02-14 — Completed 02-01 (LED Biofeedback Core Engine)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 37%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10 (from v0.4.1)
- Average duration: not tracked (pre-metrics)
- Total execution time: not tracked

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1-4 (v0.4.1) | 10 | - | - |
| 01-01 (v0.4.5) | 1 | 12min | 12min |
| 01-02 (v0.4.5) | 1 | 6min | 6min |
| 02-01 (v0.4.5) | 1 | 6min | 6min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.4.5 init]: Data Foundation must ship before LED/Quality/Suggestions (dependency)
- [v0.4.5 init]: Data capture for all tiers, gating at UI/feature level only (GATE-04)
- [v0.4.1]: 38 characterization tests lock in existing workout behavior
- [01-01]: SubscriptionTier separate from SubscriptionStatus (tier = feature access, status = payment state)
- [01-01]: RepMetricData uses FloatArray/LongArray for performance; JSON serialization deferred to Plan 02
- [01-01]: domain/premium/ package established for subscription and gating utilities
- [01-02]: Manual JSON serialization (joinToString/split) for primitive arrays instead of kotlinx.serialization
- [01-02]: Serialization helpers marked internal - repository layer implementation detail
- [02-01]: Injectable timeProvider lambda for deterministic test control in LedFeedbackController
- [02-01]: Reused FakeBleRepository with colorSchemeCommands tracking rather than new test double
- [02-01]: Internal visibility on resolver methods for white-box testing of boundary conditions
